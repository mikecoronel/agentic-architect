# USER PROMPT: BANKING ARCHITECTURE RFP PROPOSAL

## TASK
I need you to create a comprehensive RFP response for a banking architecture transformation project. The proposal must demonstrate our consulting firm's methodology for enterprise architecture using TOGAF ADM framework, BIAN domain mapping, and business capability analysis.

## CONTEXT

### Project Background
**Client:** Regional Bank (Tier 2) seeking digital transformation
**Challenge:** Legacy core banking system modernization with regulatory compliance
**Timeline:** 18-month implementation with phased delivery
**Budget:** $15-20M total project value
**Scope:** Core banking, digital channels, payment processing, risk management

### RFP Requirements
The bank is requesting:
1. Business capability assessment and heat mapping
2. Process architecture analysis (L2/L3 level)
3. BIAN domain mapping and service domain identification
4. Technology capability analysis and gap assessment
5. Target state architecture design (business + technology)
6. Implementation roadmap with risk mitigation

### Our Consulting Methodology Context
Our firm specializes in banking transformations using:
- **TOGAF 9.2 ADM** as primary architecture framework
- **BIAN Service Landscape** for banking domain standardization
- **Business Process Hierarchy** (L0→L1→L2→L3) analysis
- **Capability-Based Planning** for transformation prioritization
- **Cloud-native** target state architectures

## REFERENCES

### TOGAF ADM Phases to Include

- **Product Management:** Product design, pricing, lifecycle
- **Channel Management:** Digital channels, omnichannel experience
- **Operations Management:** Transaction processing, settlement
- **Risk & Compliance:** Credit risk, operational risk, regulatory reporting

### Key Deliverables Expected
1. **Current State Assessment:** AS-IS architecture documentation
2. **Business Capability Heat Map:** Maturity and priority analysis
3. **Process Architecture:** L2/L3 process maps with BIAN alignment
4. **Gap Analysis:** Current vs target state differences
5. **Target Architecture:** TO-BE business and technology blueprints
6. **Transformation Roadmap:** Phased implementation with timelines
7. **Risk Assessment:** Technical, business, and regulatory risks
